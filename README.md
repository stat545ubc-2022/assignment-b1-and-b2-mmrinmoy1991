## Project Description
This repository contains Mrinmoy's Assignment B1 and B2 for the course requirement of STAT-546B at UBC Vancouver for the term 2022W. There are two different assignment submissions for this repository. 

## How to use these files?
For each assignment, there will be **.rmd** and **.md** files. If you want to run the files in your own system, download the repository files and then run the **.rmd** file, which will generate the **.md** file on your system. 

## Assignment-B1
Assignment details and instructions can be found [here](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/assignments/assignment-b1/).
Is Assignment B1, a function has been developed named, `poten_logi_param`. This function could be useful to extract the column names which might have a logical entry, but read as character in R. A logical entry can have only two factor levels. This is the central idea of developing this function. However, the function `poten_logi_param` can also be used when user wants to list out the column names based on user defined factor levels, offering flexibility and usage of function in additional context. Examples and Test results have been included in the `assignment-B1.Rmd` and `assignment-B1.md` files.

## Assignment-B2
Assignment B2 is included in a separate folder `assignmentB2`. This assignment is about a package developement. Here, I used the similar r-function `poten_logi_param` and used it in the package `rPackageMC1`. The binary file has also been provided in the repository if the installation using `devtools` does not work.
