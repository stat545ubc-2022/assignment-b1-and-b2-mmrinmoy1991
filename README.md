## Project Description
This repository contains Mrinmoy's Assignment B-1 and B-2 for the course requirement of STAT-546B at UBC Vancouver for the term 2022W. There are two different assignment submissions for this repository. 

## How to use these files?
For each assignment, there will be **.rmd** and **.md** files. If you want to run the files in your own system, download the repository files and then run the **.rmd** file, which will generate the **.md** file on your system. 

## Assignment B-1
